# Matrix Calculator  

This is a simple matrix calculator that allows you to perform various matrix operations including transpose, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and spectral projector.  

## Getting started  

To use this calculator, you first need to create a matrix by entering the number of rows and columns separated by a comma in the "Matrix size" entry field and clicking the "Create Matrix" button. This will generate a grid of entry fields where you can enter the elements of your matrix.  

## Transpose  

Once you have created your matrix, you can click the "Transpose" button to calculate the transpose of your matrix. The result will be displayed in a message box.  

## Determinant  

You can also calculate the determinant of your matrix by clicking the "Determinant" button. The result will be displayed in a message box.  

## Inverse

You can calculate the inverse of your matrix by clicking the "Inverse" button. The result will be displayed in a message box. If the matrix is not invertible, an error message will be displayed.  

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  

You can calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of your matrix by clicking the "Eigenvalues" and "Eigenvectors" buttons respectively. The results will be displayed in separate message boxes.  

## Spectral Projector  

You can calculate the spectral projector of your matrix by clicking the "Spectral Projector" button. The result will be displayed in a message box.  

## Note Bene  

Please note that this program uses the numpy library to perform matrix operations, so you will need to have numpy installed to use this calculator.
